# Chapter 2 – Machine Learning Basics

## Overview
This chapter delves into the fundamentals of Machine Learning, explaining its core principles, types, and common algorithms.

## Key Concepts
- What is Machine Learning?
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning
- Model Training and Evaluation

## Explanation
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.

**Supervised Learning** involves training a model on a labeled dataset, meaning the input data is paired with the correct output. The model learns to map inputs to outputs, and then can make predictions on new, unseen data. Common tasks include classification (e.g., spam detection) and regression (e.g., house price prediction).

**Unsupervised Learning**, in contrast, works with unlabeled data. The goal is to discover hidden patterns or intrinsic structures within the input data. Clustering (e.g., customer segmentation) and dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA) are typical unsupervised tasks.

**Reinforcement Learning** is a behavioral learning model where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions in an environment to achieve a goal. It learns through trial and error, receiving rewards for desirable actions and penalties for undesirable ones.

**Model Training and Evaluation** are crucial steps in ML. Training involves feeding data to the algorithm to allow it to learn. Evaluation measures the model's performance and generalization ability on unseen data using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Examples / Use Cases
- **Supervised Learning**:
  - **Email Spam Detection**: Classifying emails as spam or not spam based on historical labeled data.
  - **Stock Price Prediction**: Predicting future stock prices based on past market data.
- **Unsupervised Learning**:
  - **Customer Segmentation**: Grouping customers with similar purchasing behaviors for targeted marketing.
  - **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying unusual patterns in network traffic to detect cyber threats.
- **Reinforcement Learning**:
  - **Game AI**: Training AI agents to play complex games like Chess or Go by rewarding winning moves.
  - **Robotics**: Teaching robots to perform tasks through interaction with their environment.

## Summary
- Machine Learning is a subset of AI enabling systems to learn from data.
- Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning are the three main types.
- Supervised learning uses labeled data for prediction (classification, regression).
- Unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data (clustering, dimensionality reduction).
- Reinforcement learning agents learn through rewards and penalties in an environment.
- Training and evaluation are vital for model development and performance assessment.
