# AI Book – First Attempt Using DocCursor and Spec Kit Plus

Welcome to my **first attempt at writing a book** using **DocCursor** and **Spec Kit Plus**. This project marks the beginning of my journey into structured, specification-driven book creation. Below is a detailed overview of the project, tools used, workflow, and lessons learned.

## Project Structure

The book project is organized in a clean and structured way:

- `ai_book/` – Main directory containing all book content.
- `ai_book/static/img/` – Folder for static assets like illustrations. Example: `undraw_docusaurus_tree.svg`.
- `ai_book/tasks.md` – Markdown file documenting tasks, workflows, and chapter structure.
- `ai_book/tsconfig.json` – TypeScript configuration for safe, maintainable code integration with Spec Kit Plus.

## Tools and Environment

- **DocCursor** – Used for real-time specification tracking and structured editing of book content.
- **Spec Kit Plus** – Scaffolded and maintained the specification-driven content, ensuring a clean and organized workflow.
- **TypeScript** – Ensures type safety and smooth integration with Spec Kit Plus.
- **Git** – Version control system used to track progress and synchronize with the remote repository.
- **GitHub Repository** – [spec-driven-books](https://github.com/Azmat-Masih/spec-driven-books.git).

## Workflow

1. Writing and editing content in **DocCursor**, keeping all specifications in mind.
2. Organizing static assets and images to maintain consistency across markdown files.
3. Using Git for version control:
   - `git pull origin main --rebase` to fetch and rebase remote changes.
   - `git push origin main` to save changes to the remote repository.
4. Managing project structure and TypeScript configuration to support Spec Kit Plus features.

## Challenges and Learning

- This is my first book attempt, so integrating **DocCursor** with **Spec Kit Plus** required experimentation.
- Learned Git workflows like rebasing and resolving conflicts to maintain a linear commit history.
- Organized assets and markdown files to ensure the book is structured for scalability and readability.

## Outcome

- Initial chapters and tasks are structured and documented.
- Assets have been uploaded and linked correctly in the project.
- All changes are pushed to the remote repository, creating a solid foundation for future iterations.

## Next Steps

- Expand the book content and structure following specification-driven principles.
- Integrate advanced Spec Kit Plus features to automate content validation.
- Improve workflow efficiency with DocCursor, Git, and TypeScript integration.

This project serves as the foundation for a full-fledged specification-driven book. Future updates will refine the content, add chapters, and enhance automation and tooling.
