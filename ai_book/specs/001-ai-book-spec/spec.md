## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Read AI Book Chapters (Priority: P1)

As a reader, I want to easily navigate and read the 10 chapters of the AI Book on a Docusaurus-powered website.

**Why this priority**: Core functionality of the book.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing the deployed website and navigating through all chapters via the sidebar and pagination.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** the reader accesses the AI Book website, **When** they click on a chapter in the sidebar, **Then** the content of that chapter is displayed.
2.  **Given** the reader is viewing a chapter, **When** they click "Next" or "Previous" pagination links, **Then** they are navigated to the adjacent chapter.
3.  **Given** the reader accesses the AI Book website, **When** they click on any of the 10 chapters, **Then** they can view the full chapter content.

### User Story 2 - Search Book Content (Priority: P2)

As a reader, I want to be able to search the content of the AI Book to quickly find relevant information.

**Why this priority**: Improves usability and content discoverability.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by entering search terms into the search bar and verifying relevant results are displayed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** the reader is on any page of the AI Book website, **When** they use the search bar, **Then** relevant results from the book's content are displayed.

### User Story 3 - View Auto-generated Specifications (Priority: P2)

As a developer or architect, I want to view the auto-generated documentation from Spec Kit Plus within the Docusaurus site to understand the project's structure and schema.

**Why this priority**: Provides critical documentation for project contributors.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating to the "Specifications" section and verifying that the generated schema documentation is present and readable.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** a user accesses the AI Book website, **When** they navigate to the "Specifications" section, **Then** the content from `generated.md` (derived from `schema.json`) is displayed.

### User Story 4 - Access Meta-documents (Constitution, Plan, Tasks, Implement) (Priority: P3)

As a project contributor, I want to access the project's meta-documents (Constitution, Plan, Tasks, Implement) from the Docusaurus site.

**Why this priority**: Provides essential project context and guidance.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating to the links for these meta-documents and verifying their content is displayed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** a project contributor accesses the AI Book website, **When** they click on links for "Constitution", "Plan", "Tasks", or "Implement", **Then** the respective markdown content is displayed.

### Edge Cases

- What happens if a chapter file is missing or malformed?
  - **Clarification**: The system should attempt to render partial content and highlight missing sections.
- How does the system handle search queries that yield no results?
- What is the behavior if `generated.md` is not present or invalid?
