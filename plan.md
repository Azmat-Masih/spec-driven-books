# Implementation Plan: AI Book Project

**Feature Branch**: `001-ai-book-spec`  
**Created**: 2025-11-25  
**Status**: Draft

## 1. Overview

This plan details the implementation strategy for the AI Book Project, focusing on a one-go writing plan and leveraging Docusaurus with Spec Kit Plus for documentation generation and management.

## 2. Technical Context

### 2.1 Technologies & Libraries

*   **Frontend**: Docusaurus (latest stable version)
    *   **Purpose**: Static site generation, documentation framework, theming, navigation, search.
    *   **Key Features Used**: Markdown rendering, sidebar generation, pagination, dark/light mode, responsive design.
*   **Specification Management**: Spec Kit Plus (latest stable version)
    *   **Purpose**: Define and manage content schema, auto-generate documentation.
    *   **Key Features Used**: JSON Schema definition, `generated.md` creation.
*   **Content Format**: Markdown (`.md`, `.mdx`)
    *   **Purpose**: Authoring chapters and meta-documents.
*   **Styling**: Custom CSS (within Docusaurus framework)
*   **Runtime**: Node.js (for Docusaurus CLI)

### 2.2 Architecture

The architecture is a static site generated by Docusaurus.

*   **Source Files**:
    *   `/book/`: Contains all 10 chapters as Markdown files (`chapter-01.md` to `chapter-10.md`).
    *   `/specification/`: Contains `schema.json` for content schema.
    *   Root directory: `constitution.md`, `specify.md`, `tasks.md`, `plan.md`, `implement.md`.
*   **Build Process**: Docusaurus CLI will build the static site from Markdown and configuration files.
*   **Output**: Static HTML, CSS, JavaScript files in a `build/` directory.
*   **Deployment**: Standard static site hosting (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel).

## 3. Constitution Check

This plan aligns with the following articles of the AI Book Constitution:

*   **Article I – Purpose of the AI Book**:
    *   1.1 Education: The Docusaurus site will provide an accessible learning pathway.
    *   1.2 Standardization: Spec Kit Plus and consistent Markdown ensures standardization.
    *   1.3 Access & Openness: Publicly accessible site without authentication (FR-022).
    *   1.5 Innovation Support: Serves as a reference guide.
*   **Article III – Structure of the Book**: The plan explicitly follows the 10-chapter structure and includes supporting meta-documents.
*   **Article IV – Methodology**:
    *   4.1 Clarity & Simplicity: Markdown content and Docusaurus presentation.
    *   4.2 Technical Accuracy: Content focus (to be enforced during content creation).
    *   4.4 Practical Orientation: Chapters include examples, use cases, code snippets.
*   **Article V – Specification Governance**: Spec Kit Plus for schema and auto-generated docs.
*   **Article VI – Development Process**: Workflow aligns with `Draft → Review → Revise → Finalize → Publish` for content, and continuous integration/deployment for the site.
*   **Article VII – Review & Quality Control**: Emphasizes content quality and continuous improvement.
*   **Article VIII – Ethical Commitments**: Public accessibility (FR-022) aligns with fairness and inclusivity.

## 4. Gates

### 4.1 Readiness Gates

*   **Spec Clarity**: All critical ambiguities in `spec.md` are resolved. (Achieved via `/sp.clarify`)
*   **Resource Availability**: Development environment (Node.js, npm/yarn) is set up.

### 4.2 Exit Gates

*   **Test Coverage**: All user stories have defined acceptance criteria and can be independently tested.
*   **Build Success**: The Docusaurus site builds without errors.
*   **Deployment Readiness**: The static site is ready for deployment to a chosen hosting platform.

## 5. Phase 0: Research (Completed)

During the `/sp.clarify` phase, the following research questions were effectively resolved and integrated into `spec.md` as Functional Requirements:

*   **Handling Missing/Malformed Content**: `FR-020` - Attempt to render partial content and highlight missing sections.
*   **Page Load Performance**: `FR-021` - Initial page loads MUST be under 1 second, subsequent under 500ms.
*   **Authentication/Authorization**: `FR-022` - No authentication/authorization required; all content is publicly accessible.
*   **Accessibility/Localization**: `FR-023` - Adhere to Docusaurus default accessibility and localization standards.
*   **Technology Versions**: `FR-024` - Utilize the latest stable versions of Docusaurus and Spec Kit Plus.

Therefore, no further research is immediately required at this stage.

## 6. Phase 1: Design & Contracts

### 6.1 Data Model (`data-model.md`)

Based on the `Key Entities` in `spec.md`:

```markdown
# Data Model: AI Book Project

## Entities

### Chapter

*   **Description**: Represents a single chapter of the AI Book.
*   **Attributes**:
    *   `chapterNumber`: Integer (1-10), Unique, Required.
    *   `title`: String, Required.
    *   `summary`: String, Required.
    *   `content`: String (Markdown), Required.
    *   `keywords`: Array of Strings, Optional.
*   **Relationships**: Part of the AI Book.

### Specification

*   **Description**: Represents the auto-generated documentation from the content schema (`schema.json`).
*   **Attributes**:
    *   `title`: String, Required.
    *   `content`: String (Markdown, derived from `schema.json`), Required.
*   **Relationships**: Part of the project documentation.

### Meta-Document

*   **Description**: Represents supplementary project documents (e.g., Constitution, Plan, Tasks, Implement).
*   **Attributes**:
    *   `title`: String, Required.
    *   `content`: String (Markdown), Required.
    *   **Relationships**: Part of the project documentation.
```

### 6.2 API Contracts (`contracts/`)

For a static site generated by Docusaurus, traditional API contracts for data fetching (REST/GraphQL) are generally not applicable. Content is served directly as static files.

However, if "API Contracts" refers to the structure of how Docusaurus expects its content (e.g., frontmatter, file paths), then the `spec.md` already defines these implicitly through the `Project Structure Specification` and `Metadata Specification (Frontmatter)`.

No explicit `contracts/` directory with OpenAPI/GraphQL schemas will be generated as this is a static content site.

### 6.3 Quickstart Guide (`quickstart.md`)

```markdown
# Quickstart Guide: AI Book Project

This guide provides a minimal set of steps to get the AI Book project up and running locally.

## Prerequisites

*   Node.js (LTS version)
*   npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository_url]
    cd my-book
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # OR
    yarn install
    ```
3.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    # OR
    yarn start
    ```
    This will open the site in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Building for Production

To build the static site for deployment:

```bash
npm run build
# OR
yarn build
```

The static files will be generated in the `build/` directory.

## Content Creation

*   Chapters are located in the `book/` directory.
*   Meta-documents (constitution.md, specify.md, tasks.md, plan.md, implement.md) are in the root directory.
*   Edit Markdown files to update content. Docusaurus will hot-reload changes in development mode.
```

## 7. Agent Context Update

The agent context has already been updated implicitly by the clarifications and the understanding of the project structure and technologies. No specific script call is needed at this point as the context is being managed by the interactive session.

## 8. Re-evaluate Constitution Check (Post-Design)

The design decisions (static site, Markdown content, Docusaurus for presentation, Spec Kit Plus for schema management) continue to align with the AI Book Constitution.
*   **Article II – Scope of the Book**: The chosen architecture effectively supports the content scope.
*   **Article V – Specification Governance**: The use of Spec Kit Plus and the plan for `data-model.md` reinforces the governance principles.
*   **Article IX – Rights & Responsibilities**: Maintainers' duties are supported by a clear, buildable, and deployable site.

## 9. Next Steps

The next phase involves generating the `tasks.md` file, which will break down the implementation into actionable steps.
